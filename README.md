# BookedUp Backend

## Overview
BookedUp's backend is developed in Java using Maven as the build tool. 
The backend is responsible for handling server-side operations, managing databases, and facilitating communication between the mobile app and the server. 
The backend is designed to support three distinct user roles: host, guest, and admin.
